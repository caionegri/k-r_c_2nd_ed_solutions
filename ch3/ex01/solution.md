## The C Programming Language - 2nd Edition, Exercise 3-1.

Each function was called 10,000,000 times and I measured the number
of clock cycles using clock(). Repeated 5 times and took the average.

* Original binsearch: average 718.2 clock cycles
* Modified binsearch: average 718.0 clock cycles

Conclusion: No significant difference in performance.
