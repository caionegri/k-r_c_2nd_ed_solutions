# My Solutions for The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition by K&amp;R

I am working through reading the book and solving every exercise along the way. My solutions will be available here in hopes that they can help someone or attract contructive criticism :).

## Some Considerations

* I am running Windows 10 and compiling the code with GCC (using Cygwin).
* Even though I have some prior knowledge of C, I'm doing my best to only use the concepts already presented in the book to solve each problem.
* I'm using Doxygen comment blocks to generate documentation automaticly, so don't be alarmed if the comments look a bit wierd.
* Since my programming style is all over the place and I'm still learning alot, there might be inconcistency between older and newer code formatting.
